| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| _netflix-practice.md_ | Queries that perform the requested operations correctly: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7<br><br>Query 2 doesn‚Äôt sort right‚Äîthe intent to sort ascending by year is there but it isn‚Äôt done right (as evidenced by the query result!) (‚Äì1)<br><br>Queries 3, 5, 6, and 7 have incorrect case in the image file links (`png` instead of `PNG`). Looks like you didn‚Äôt double-check how GitHub rendered this Markdown! Make sure you always look at file submissions after pushing (‚Äì0.5 each, ‚Äì2 overall) | 25/28 |
| _.gitignore_ | _.gitignore_ contains appropriate ignores |  |
| _schema.pdf/md_ and/or mappings | Schema documentation is clear, although it doesn‚Äôt follow the JSON-like notation specified in the instructions (‚Äì1)<br><br>Note how with this database, you run a high risk of denormalization because you‚Äôre very likely to have copied cast and crew data. Not much you can do from a schema level, but when it comes to DAL implementation, this will need to be noted | 4/5 |
| Loader programs | _main_loader.py_ appears to run without issues, but can be an _extremely_ memory-intensive approach in the general case, because the CSV files are read into memory in their entirety (line 17). If this can be done, why bother with a database, right? It just so happens that the dataset isn‚Äôt that large, but it _could be_, and if that were the case, this loader approach would not work. No deduction for this because it‚Äôs a next-level consideration, but it _is_ something to keep in mind for similar tasks in the future<br><br>Thanks for the loading instructions‚Äîcute that you got sentimental about the obsolete outdated one‚Ä¶you know it will always be there for you in the commit history, right? | 15/15 |
| _queries.md_ | Queries 1‚Äì3, 5‚Äì8 are functional and look appropriate for the domain<br><br>Query 3 would have been more interesting if it had accessed cast or crew, but the James Cameron one at the end makes up for that<br><br>Query 4 could have benefited from a secondary sort on the date, since you have some ties. I bet that if you showed this tally in a real app, the users would expect sorting by date within groups that have the same number of releases. Domain-appropriateness, remember? (‚Äì1)<br><br>Ack, incorrect image file case again. I considered whether this one is double-jeopardy, but concluded no, it isn‚Äôt‚Äîyou wouldn‚Äôt have gotten feedback in between (unless you asked for it), and both _.md_ files could have been visually eyeballed on GitHub, so it is fair to treat them separately. Sorry ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (‚Äì4 overall) | 20/25 |
| DAL module | | |
| ‚Ä¢¬†Configuration/setup | Configuration code hardcodes the database server‚Äôs URL even though code was already given or reading this from an environment variable. Please seek to understand exactly why separating this from code is very important. DALs that are written this way _have to be rewritten and redeployed_ if they are running off different servers, and _they do_: many installations have a dev system, a staging system, a QA system, a production system, and possibly more, each with different database hosts. Baking configuration information into DAL code like this means that you have to deploy _a different copy_ of this code to each of these systems, making things more complicated and error prone. Separation of configuration information from code totally solves this issue at the small cost of actually learning about environment variables. Make sure to not disregard this important aspect in future ventures (‚Äì7) | 0/7 |
| ‚Ä¢¬†Retrieval | The various R functions successfully perform their intended queries | 4/7 |
| ‚Ä¢¬†CUD | Both `removeMovie` and `updateRuntime` successfully perform their intended changes, but they could do a better job with reporting the results. They do propagate exceptions, but if you look up `deleteOne` and `updateOne`, you‚Äôll notice that they have return values when successful. These are informative, and should be used in your DAL too (‚Äì1) | 9/7 |
| DAL programs | ‚Ä¢ _search-by-title.mjs_ and _avg-rating.mjs_ check the argument count, provide help when needed, and display readable results. A corresponding message also appears when there are no matches<br><br>‚Ä¢ _update-runtime.mjs_ checks the argument count, provides help when needed, and displays readable results. It also checks data types<br><br>‚Ä¢ _remove-movie.mjs_ works equally well, including the check for an existing ID‚Äîbut won‚Äôt the underlying remove call also tell you if something got removed? | 6/6 |
| Code maintainability | You should have renamed your DAL file; it‚Äôs based on TMDB now, not Netflix (‚Äì1). Otherwise, no other major code maintainability issues were found | -1 |
| Code readability | No major code readability issues were found |  |
| Version control | Commit frequency and count seem low for the scale of this mini-stack, but messages are descriptive and‚Ä¶almost all from Jason??? And one Carter. But I didn‚Äôt hear about any internal issues so I‚Äôll presume that the division of labor is acceptable to all involved |  |
